# task 2
ok let's create some files

## we're going to use ↙️ this stuff
macOs, Terminal, bash
# Generate site
Before generating your site make sure any posts you want to publish has their `draft` parameter set to `false` in each of their YAML front matter.
1. Open Terminal
2. `cd` into desired Hugo site's root directory
3. build static HTML pages
```bash
hugo
```
4. `ls` to confirm creation of `public` directory inside Hugo site's root directory

# Push to remote repo
1. Create remote repo on GitHub for your Hugo site
2. Push root directory
3. Open browser, log onto GitHub and check that your `public` folder is showing in your repo. TODO: If not.. refer to Unit Test...

> In fact will GitHub automatically enable GitHub Pages, if a `gh-pages` branch was created, so it’s still supported.
