# Buy custom domain
1. Open browser
2. Go to domain name registrar e.g. https://www.namecheap.com/
3. Choose a domain name and gTLD e.g. https://sparky.blog/
4. Add to cart
5. **Do not** buy SSL certificate from registrar as GitHub Pages gives you one for **free**
6. Keep everything default and pay
7. Woohoo! You have your own domain now ðŸ˜Ž
8. Brace yourself for the next part and follow every step carefully
