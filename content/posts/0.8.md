# Configure DNS
1. Open browser
2. Go to registrar where you bought your custom domain e.g. https://www.namecheap.com/
3. Go to Account -> Dashboard -> Manage (for desired domain) -> Advance DNS
4. Leave everything default except `Host Records`
5. Configure host records
	1. Delete all default records
	2. Create CNAME Record
		- set `Host` to `www`
		- set `Value` to `username.github.io` (replace `username` with **your** github user name)
		- leave TTL to `Automatic`
	3. Create four A Records
		- Set all their `Host` to `@`
		- Set their values to `185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, `185.199.110.153`, `185.199.111.153`
		- leave TTL to `Automatic`
6. Don't touch anything else and get out of there!
7. If you followed every step, there is no need to come back here.

# Notes
- I repeat, there is no need to come back and fix anything in your DNS config if you have followed the above steps correctly. Keep in mind the host records do take time to be configured so sometimes you may have to wait a little for the magic to happen.
